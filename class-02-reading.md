What is one benefit of JavaScript not enforcing type?
* The benefit of javascript is we can change our object value to multiple tasks. 
What is one downside of JavaScript not enforcing type?
* Assuming we are builting a big function and by declaring multiple values to the same key name. It will give as a confusion to our work. 
Should the parameters of a function be changed when the function returns? Why or why not?
* I belive either way is possible, but i will keep the input as it is beacuse assuming when we are writing a big javascript function it will give us a hard time to differentiate which value refer's to which input.
