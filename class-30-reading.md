 -                     Implementation: Graphs 
 
 Graph is a collection of vertices or nodes, we have to know some terminologies when it comes to trees.vertices or node is the data object of a graph,Edge is a connection of two nods,  Neighbor adjustent of node connected by edge and degree is the number of edges. 
 
   - There are few different types of graphs.
   
   -1 undirected graphs 
   
   The connection of the node or vertices is bi-directional, They don't have a pointer to the next node.
   -2 Directed graphs
   
   The connection between there node is directional.
   -3 complete graphs
   
   when all nodes are connected each other
   -4 connected graph
   
   when they have the nodes at list one edge 
   -5 Disconnected graph 
   
   when some of the node have not edges. 
   -6 acyclic graph
   
   a directed graph with out cycle. 
   -7 cyclic graph
   
   A node traversed through and end up back at itself.
