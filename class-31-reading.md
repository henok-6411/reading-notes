# Readings: Redux - Combined Reducers 

- Before i jumb on to redux - combined Reducers, let me explain about redux,It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.
- We can export multiple stores from a diffterent Stores and use them in the same components. ```conbined reducers ```
-  when we are using payload or actions we need to be extra careful, because when we are using combined reducers action if they have the same case name from a different reducer we are able to use both of the states. At the same time it's powerful.
