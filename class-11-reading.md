Come up with an application scenario where you would want to use a stack?
* ticket counter line machine, where people who come first will get there ticket first .

Come up with an application scenario where you would want to use a queue?
* When a resource is shared among multiple consumers like Disk Scheduling.

Why are pop, push, enqueue and dequeue always O(1)?

* When we iterate the nodes to do listed actions,it's going to take us the same amout of time. that is why we call it 0(1).

Why do stacks and queues not have traversal or searching operations?
