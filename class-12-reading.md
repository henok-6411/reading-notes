1. Whatâ€™s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

* It allows limited access to the user's data and allows accessing when authorization tokens expire.

2. Write the following steps in the correct order

- Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
- Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
- Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
- Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
- Receive authroization code
- Make a request to the access token endpoint
- Receive access token

3. What can you do with an authorization code?

* is a unique string of random letters and numbers assigned to a domain.

4. What can you do with an access token?

* Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage.
