# Class 29 â€” Application State with Redux 


### Why would you wrap your entire application within a context?

  - To avoid nested component data structure.
  
### What is the purpose of a reducer?

 - Reducer takes state and action as an argument, It will modify the state based on the action made.  

### What does an action contain?

- The action behavior,How we want to swich from one case to another. 

### Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?

- I believe to have our previous data into our new action or reducer.
