- What is a leaf node? Why is it important to be able to find leaf nodes?
The leaf node is the last node in a tree with no attached edges - when traversing a tree, once it hits a leaf and both left and right return null, it will end the execution of the method.

- Describe the differences between pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Why are they called pre, in, and post order?

- What is the height of a fully balanced (each non-leaf node has two children) tree? What is this used for?

- How are stacks and queues used in relation to trees?

They are used to hold the place of the traversal as it goes through the tree.
