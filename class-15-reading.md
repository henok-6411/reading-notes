- What is a leaf node? Why is it important to be able to find leaf nodes?

The leaf node is the last node in a tree with no attached edges - when traversing a tree, once it hits a leaf and both left and right return null, it will end the execution of the method.

- Describe the differences between pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Why are they called pre, in, and post order?

  Tree Traversals (Inorder, Preorder and Postorder) Unlike linear data structures (Array, Linked List, Queues, Stacks, etc) which have only one logical way to traverse them, trees can be traversed in different ways. ... In case of binary search trees (BST), Inorder traversal gives nodes in non-decreasing order

- What is the height of a fully balanced (each non-leaf node has two children) tree? What is this used for?

A binary tree is a tree in which no node has more than two children, and every child is either a left child or a right child even if it is the only child its parent has. A full binary tree is one in which every internal node has two children

- How are stacks and queues used in relation to trees?

They are used to hold the place of the traversal as it goes through the tree.
